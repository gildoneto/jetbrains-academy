# Work on project. Stage 5/5: Expect the unexpected

Project: Carnival Gift Shop

## Expect the unexpected

Hard
27 minutes

## Description

We made our program run continuously, but there is a problem, as you cannot handle any unexpected inputs! The visitor could enter a different number than you provide, or they could enter a character instead of a number. Now, we will handle these cases.

For the initial input, where you ask the visitors what to do, if the visitor enters anything unexpected, output `Please enter a valid number!`

For the first option, where the visitor chooses to buy a gift, handle these cases;

- If there're no gifts left to buy, output: `Wow! There are no gifts to buy.`

- If there are non-numeric characters in the input: `Please enter a valid number!`

- If there are no gifts with that number. Output this message: `There is no gift with that number!`

- If the visitor doesn’t have enough tickets to buy a gift: `You don't have enough tickets to buy this gift.`

For the second option, where the visitor enters the number of tickets they want to add, handle these cases:

- if they enter a non-numeric value.
- the number they enter should be between `0` and `1000` (both inclusive).

Output this message if any of these cases happen: `Please enter a valid number between 0 and 1000.`

For the last option, where you show the list of gifts, if there are no gifts left to offer, output this message again: `Wow! There are no gifts to buy.`

Following the previous stage, the program will run until the exit prompt is entered.

You can use the [isNaN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number/isNaN) built-in method to check if an input is a number.

## 2. Objectives

In this stage, your program should:

1. Print the welcoming and greeting messages from the previous stage;
2. Print the list of gifts;
3. Handle the initial input where the user chooses what to do and handle any unexpected inputs;
4. Handle the option to buy a gift and handle all of the cases mentioned above;
5. Handle the option to add more tickets to the total tickets and handle all of the cases mentioned above;
6. Handle the option to see the total tickets;
7. Handle the option to see the list of gifts and handle all of the cases mentioned above;
8. Handle the option to quit the program;
9. Run continuously;
10. Terminate the program the message.

## 3. Examples

The greater-than symbol followed by a space (`> `) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.

**Example 1:** *where the program handles an unexpected input at the initial stage*
